# doc_generator_from_template
py script to generate a word doc based off of a microsoft wrod template.
By providing a doc template file with values you would like to replace within brackets, modify and run the script to generate a new curated word doc with teh values within brackets replaced with values of your choosing.

Vital to generate multiple documents with slight variances from an initial template file provided (think letter addressed to multiple people but contents of the letter would prove to be much the same)
